Here are prompts you can use with ChatGPT to generate the content for your document:

1. **Introduction of the Architecture**  
   *"Explain a Linux Server Health Monitoring and Analysis System where data collection and machine learning analysis are separated into 
     different components to ensure scalability and security. Focus on the system collecting metrics from Linux servers and sending them to 
     a central analysis server where TensorFlow analysis is performed on a dedicated machine."*

2. **Metrics Collector**  
   *"Describe the Metrics Collector, a component running on the Linux server being monitored, responsible for collecting system metrics 
     such as CPU, memory, disk usage, swap, and kernel parameters, and sending them to a central analysis server via HTTP."*

3. **Analysis Server Overview**  
   *"Provide an overview of the Analysis Server. It receives data from the Metrics Collector, runs machine learning analysis using TensorFlow, 
   and stores results in an SQLite3 database for historical records. This server is responsible for performance tuning recommendations."*

4. **Web Console Overview**  
   *"Explain the Web Console, which runs on the Analysis Server, allowing users to interact with stored data and visualize historical results. 
     It is built using "Flask-Admin with AdminLTE" and is capable of managing analysis, starting or stopping collection, and viewing or deleting historical results. 
     Data is stored in SQLite3 for management."*

5. **System Diagram**  
   *"Generate a diagram showing the Linux Server (Metrics Collector), Analysis Server (ML model, SQLite3, "Flask-Admin with AdminLTE" web dashboard), 
     and the Web Console that starts analysis, views results, and historical data."*

6. **Step-by-Step Code for Metrics Collector**  
   *"Create Python code that collects Linux server metrics such as memory, CPU, disk usage, swap, and kernel parameters, then sends them via HTTP to a central analysis server. Ensure that the code includes functions for collecting each type of data and an HTTP POST to transmit the data."*

7. **Step-by-Step Code for Analysis Server with TensorFlow**  
   *"Write Python code for a Flask-based Analysis Server that receives system metrics from the Metrics Collector, processes the data through a pre-trained TensorFlow model, and stores the results in SQLite3. The server should expose an endpoint `/analyze` for receiving metrics, and return analysis results along with recommendations."*

8. **"Flask-Admin with AdminLTE" and SQLite Integration for Web Console**  
   *"Explain how to integrate "Flask-Admin with AdminLTE" with an SQLite3 database to create a web dashboard for visualizing historical analysis results. Include details about how to configure "Flask-Admin with AdminLTE" to query the SQLite3 database and display server health data."*

9. **SQLite Setup**  
   *"Provide instructions for setting up an SQLite3 database for storing analysis results, with a schema that tracks incoming data and the results of the machine learning analysis."*

10. **TensorFlow Prediction Explanation**  
    *"Describe how TensorFlow is used to analyze the system metrics received from the Metrics Collector. Detail how the model processes the input data, makes predictions, and assigns performance tuning recommendations such as kernel parameter adjustments or hardware upgrades."*
