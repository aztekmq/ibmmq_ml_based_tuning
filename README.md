### IBM MQ Machine Learning Tuning

This system works by splitting up tasks across different computers so that each one does a specific job.

### 1. **Metrics Collector (Data Gatherer)**:
   - **What it does**: Its job is to gather information from the computer it's on. It looks at things like how much CPU (processing power) is used, memory, disk space, and other system stats, then sends this info to another computer for analysis.
   - **Important Points**:
     - **Work fast**: Since this program is running on a computer that's being watched, it shouldn't use too many resources. It should work quickly and quietly.
     - **Secure the data**: Make sure the data is sent safely using something like HTTPS, so no one can steal important information about the computer's settings.
     - **Be ready for problems**: If the computer that analyzes the data isn't available, the collector should try again later or save the error.

### 2. **Analysis Server (Data Analyzer)**:
   - **What it does**: This computer takes the collected information, runs it through a machine learning program (TensorFlow), and gives advice on how to improve performance.
   - **Machine Learning (ML) Part**:
     - **Model**: It uses a pre-trained program (`server_health_model.h5`). Keep the program updated with new information so that it stays smart and gives good advice.
     - **Cleaning the data**: Before the program can look at the data, it needs to make sure it's clean and correct—like making sure there are no missing or wrong numbers.
   - **Database (SQLite3)**:
     - **Storing results**: The server keeps track of all the analyses it does in a simple database. Over time, as more data gets added, it should be organized so it doesn’t slow down.
     - **Performance**: For small or medium tasks, this database works fine, but for bigger tasks, a more powerful database like PostgreSQL might be needed.

### 3. **Web Console (User Dashboard)**:
   - **What it does**: This is like the control panel where users can see charts that show the computer's health (CPU, memory, disk usage), start or stop the analysis, and look at past data.
   - **Setting it up**:
     - **Charts**: The dashboard shows easy-to-read charts that track how the system is doing over time and offers tips from the analysis server.
     - **Filters and Reports**: Users can focus on specific times or types of data, and download reports to keep.
     - **Security**: Make sure only the right people can access this dashboard, since it shows important and private information.

### 4. **General Improvements**:
   - **Scaling Up**: If you need to monitor more than one computer, make sure the system can handle that by expanding the collector and analysis server.
   - **Notifications**: Set up alerts that notify users by email or text message if the analysis finds big problems (like low disk space or high CPU usage).
   - **Monitoring the System**: Keep an eye on the health of both the collector and analysis server to make sure they don’t have problems themselves.

This setup splits up the work to make it more secure and easier to manage.
