## Section 1: Metrics Collector 

### Overview

The **Metrics Collector** is a standalone component running on the same server as the IBM MQ Queue Manager. Its function is to gather system metrics such as CPU, memory, disk, and kernel parameters. Once a full collection period, as specified by the user, is completed, it transmits the metrics to the **Analysis Server** via REST API.

### Objectives

The key objectives of the **Metrics Collector** are:
1. **Lightweight Data Collection**: Operate with minimal resource overhead.
2. **Comprehensive Metrics**: Gather CPU, memory, disk, swap usage, and kernel parameters.
3. **Secure Data Transfer**: Safely send the collected data to the Analysis Server.
4. **Reliability**: Handle network outages or server unavailability gracefully.

---

### Core Components

1. **CPU Usage Collection**
2. **Memory Usage Collection**
3. **Disk and Swap Space Collection**
4. **Kernel Parameter Collection**
5. **Data Transmission to Analysis Server**

---

### Metrics Collection

The **Metrics Collector** uses Linux utilities to collect system data:
- **CPU Usage**: Extracted via the `top` command.
- **Memory and Swap Usage**: Extracted using the `free` command.
- **Disk Usage**: Gathered using the `df` command.
- **Kernel Parameters**: Collected using the `sysctl` command to retrieve specific parameters.

---

### Data Transmission to Analysis Server

The collected metrics are compiled into a JSON object and sent to the **Analysis Server** via an HTTP POST request.

```python
def send_data_to_analysis_server():
    data = collect_data()
    response = requests.post('http://<ANALYSIS_SERVER_IP>/analyze', json=data)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Data successfully sent for analysis")
    else:
        print("Failed to send data")
```

---

### Conclusion

The **Metrics Collector** ensures minimal system impact while collecting a full set of performance metrics. This data is transmitted securely and reliably to the **Analysis Server** for in-depth analysis.

---

## Section 2: Analysis Server

### Overview

The **Analysis Server** is responsible for receiving the system metrics from the **Metrics Collector** and analyzing the data using machine learning techniques such as **TensorFlow** and **LLaMA** models. The results of this analysis are stored in a database along with a **Rating Index** and performance tuning recommendations.

---

### Data Processing with TensorFlow and LLaMA

The server receives data via its REST API and processes it through TensorFlow models for health evaluation and performance recommendations. **LLaMA** further enhances the analysis by summarizing the results.

---

### Rating Index and Tuning Recommendations

- **Rating Index**: After processing, the system assigns a score based on the system's health.
- **Tuning Recommendations**: The server suggests adjustments to kernel parameters, system resources (RAM, CPU), and other critical metrics to optimize performance.

---

### Conclusion

The **Analysis Server** forms the core of the system by analyzing the incoming metrics and providing actionable insights to optimize server performance. All recommendations and scores are stored in a database for historical reference.

---

## Section 3: Web Console

### Overview

The **Web Console** provides an interface running on the **Analysis Server**. It allows users to interact with the stored data, review historical metrics, and export the results in formats such as Excel or PDF.

---

### Features and User Interaction

- **Dashboard**: Displays historical records of performance metrics and recommendations.
- **Data Export**: Users can export data to PDF, Excel, or other formats.
- **Filtering and Sorting**: The interface allows filtering data for specific time periods, parameters, or servers.

---

### Conclusion

The **Web Console** gives users easy access to the metrics and analysis results, allowing them to manage server health visually and intuitively. It acts as the final step in the system's workflow, presenting the results from the **Metrics Collector** and **Analysis Server** in an accessible format.
